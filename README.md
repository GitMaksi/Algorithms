# C# Algorithm Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of classic algorithms implemented in C#. The primary goal of this project is to offer a comprehensive set of algorithms for educational purposes, ranging from simple sorting algorithms to more complex graph-based algorithms. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand how these fundamental algorithms work and how they are implemented in C#.

## Algorithms Included
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

- **Search Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- **Graph Algorithms**
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm

- **Other Algorithms**
  - Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
  - Sieve of Eratosthenes for Prime Numbers
  - Factorial Calculation

## Getting Started
To run these algorithms:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in an IDE that supports C# (like Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select and run a specific algorithm.

## Usage
The program is a console application. On startup, it presents a menu where you can choose which algorithm to run. Each algorithm has a corresponding demonstration method that showcases its functionality with example data.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. Feel free to fork the repo, add your own algorithm implementations or improvements, and open a pull request.
